## Problem Statement

Creating and managing NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) requires an efficient and straightforward system to mint, list, and keep track of the total supply of NFTs. This project aims to develop a basic NFT management system using JavaScript, which allows users to mint new NFTs, list all the minted NFTs, and check the total supply of NFTs.

## Description

This NFT management system is a simple JavaScript application that enables users to perform the following operations:

1. *Mint new NFTs*: Create new NFTs by providing a name, age, and work. Each NFT will be assigned a unique ID automatically.
2. *List all NFTs*: Display all the minted NFTs with their details such as ID, name, age, and work.
3. *Get total supply*: Retrieve the total number of minted NFTs.

## Features

- *Minting NFTs*: Users can mint new NFTs by providing specific attributes (name, age, work). Each NFT is assigned a unique ID.
- *Listing NFTs*: Users can view all the minted NFTs along with their attributes.
- *Total Supply*: Users can get the total count of minted NFTs.

## Technologies Used

- *JavaScript*: The core programming language used to implement the NFT management functionality.
- *Console*: For displaying the output and interacting with the users.
